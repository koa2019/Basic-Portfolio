# Basic-Portfolio

I could not get the figcaptions to the bottom of the image on portfolio.html.
I tried making the parent div which is container position: relative and then made the 
child <figcaption> position relative with top:200; but it would budge. I tried making the other divs container2, boxset position: relative, but that didn't work either.
